## What is Dinoksetiid?

Dinoksetiid is built around [Shattered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84320), meaning the world is empty. No quests, NPCs, life. Instead, through the [World Eater](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85133) mod, a new main quest is added and the world is populated with draugr. Your task is to purge the evil things from the province and discover what happened, why the world is dead.

In a way, this list is a zombie survival game, as you will at times find yourself fighting hoards of enemies. At other times, it will feel much more "souls" inspired, with the unique bosses you can fight and gear you can find. Elden Ring was a massive inspiration for this list both aesthetically and gameplay-wise, but it is not a "souls" clone.

## Controls

![Controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Geborgen/dinoksetiid/main/.github/controls.png)

Above are the default controls for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad. Key bindings highlighted in green use `SHIFT` as a modifier. Most gamepad bindings with more than one option use `DPAD UP` as a modifier. You can press  `F11`  in-game to access this menu at any time.

## Core Gameplay

Dino's gameplay is focused around [Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72352) paired with [MCO](https://www.distaranimation.com/mods/attack) and [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), providing a difficult yet fair overhaul to the game's mechanics.

### Perks

As mentioned earlier, [Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72352) is the primary perk system used in Dino. This mod is very unique, so if you aren't familiar with it, I recommend fully reading this section in addition to the mod page itself.

The core concept of Synergy is that experience cannot be gained in a skill without an initial aspiration perk. This means that all skills start at level one. If you do not have this aspiration perk, attempting to do something related to the skill will be impractical or downright useless (crafting equipment is unusable, stealth is nearly impossible, weapons do little damage, etc.).

As soon as you make your character, you will be granted three perk points, to select your starting aspiration perks. This acts as a pseudo class system. From then on, after level one, you will need corresponding skill books to select new aspiration perks. You can sometimes buy skill books from general merchants. Reading skill books will increase your leveling speed for their respective skill.

Perks do not have any skill requirement. Instead of  providing static buffs, they increase the aptness of a skill based on your level. Perks can also open up new mechanics or grant buffs/abilities under certain conditions.

### Talents

When entering your tween menu, you may notice a new tab has been added, called Talents. In addition to Synergy's perk trees, Dino utilizes [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423) to add a few additional perk trees with extra skills.

[Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) adds a shout skill tree, in addition to Synergy's shout perks. This allows for much more in-depth progression as you discover more shouts. You can acquire perks for this skill tree by killing dragons and absorbing their souls.

[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) adds perks related to deity worship with the [CSF add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93913). You gain experience by being in combat with an active shrine blessing, and regular perk points are used.

[The Dragon Cult - Priesthood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92794) adds a skill tree allowing you to unlock perks relating to Dragon Priests. You can gain perks by killing Draugr while wearing a Dragon Priest mask.

### Leveling

[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) paired with [Static Skill Leveling Rewritten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89940) reworks how leveling functions within the game. The idea is, skills no longer contribute to your overall level. Instead, you can gain experience by questing, exploring, clearing dungeons, defeating enemies, and reading.

When you level up, you gain a certain amount of skill points. These skill points can be distributed to various different skills to level them. You can only distribute a certain amount of skill points per skill per level. This can all be configured via MCM.

### Combat

[MCO](https://www.distaranimation.com/mods/attack) is included, with grounded and non-flashy movesets. You can power attack with `M3`. You can [dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) as well, using `C` or `SHIFT` with your weapon drawn. Combat is meant for third person, but playable in first person as well.

Despite using the DXP version of MCO, *directional power attacks are enabled*. This is because Synergy has perks relating to directional power attacks, providing unique bonuses.

[Valravn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53869) improves the actual combat systems. Stamina is a more important resource that will regenerate faster with weapons sheathed. You can also take advantages of attacks of opportunity. It also makes changes to  armor and resistances, blocking, and stagger. This mod has quite a few mechanics, so as always, I recommend reading through the mod page.

### Magic

Synergy, while primarily a perk mod, includes changes to the magic system. All scrolls and staves have been changed to have their affects match their associated spell. The difference in spell ranks has been made more significant (spells of a higher rank are more powerful but take longer to cast). The mod also changes some vanilla spells and adds a few new ones. [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) is also included as a proper magic overhaul with more spell diversity and archetypes.

### Survival

[Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) is a lightweight overhaul to survival mode, with simple systems for hunger, weariness, and cold. Due to the lack of a carriage system, fast travel is enabled by default, even with survival mode enabled.

CC Camping is included as well, with the [expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73354) giving you a proper mobile base.

Survival is off by default. You can enable it through the gameplay settings menu.

### Other Mechanics

[Evenstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41256) overhauls standing stones, making them more focused around passive buffs. Except for the guardian stones, you won't be able to unlock them without defeating a nearby enemy, due to [Standing Stone Limitations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94008). This encourages exploration. The enemies are slightly higher level, but they level with you.

[Wheeler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345)  is a UI mod that adds a quick action wheel. Press  `G`. The mod page has instructions for use, they haven't been modified for the list. It should be noted that there is a crash with self-made potions/poisons/etc. and you use the last one on the wheel. If this happens, open dMenu with  `PGUP`, find Wheeler's config, and reset all wheels. Please do not submit this as a bug report.

## Quests

[World Eater](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85133) is the main quest, adding a story to the Shattered world. You begin this automatically, talk to the Khajiit in the starting shack.

[Ghosts of the Past](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93338), [Forbidden Goods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93593), and [Knights of None](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96565) are part of the Age of Silence series of mods. They add interaction-based quests and NPCs that help flesh out the world. They're meant to be discovered by exploring, but you can refer to the mod pages for more information as some may be out of the way.

[Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155) is a quest mod involving a castle high in the Velothi Mountains, lost to the world for over a hundred years. Once found, you may call Clockwork Castle home... but if you want to leave, you'll need to discover how to escape. To get started, wait for an NPC carrying a note to attack you in the wilderness, or head straight to the Velothi Mountain Tunnels, north of Mzulft and Harold Hold.

[Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) is a Dark Souls inspired quest/new land mod. Travel to the island of Pharos, explore detailed environments, fight new enemies and discover an ancient set of weapons of incredible power. To get started, travel to Voyager's end, a shipwreck northwest of Winterhold.

## Enemies and NPCs

[Abjects](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98859) adds 13 new bosses. They are open world, but there is a quest that leads you to each one, showing you the proper order as they do get progressively stronger. You can start the quest by grabbing the note on the table in the starting shack.

There are several added enemies that spawn with leveled lists. You begin to see these as you level higher. There are also several hand-placed enemies. I will leave these for you to discover, but you can always check the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/dinoksetiid).

Dino also includes 12 custom NPCs as ways to distribute unique armor sets. They're kind of out of the way, in interiors. These NPCs are not meant to be fully fleshed-out bosses; they're more like high level bandits.

<details><summary>Custom NPC Locations (expand)</summary>

### Custom NPC Locations

| Name | Armor | Location | Level |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Avier of Rihad | Rihad Swordsman | Fort Greymoor | 15 |

You can also find two bandits on the road leading to Hammerfell, kill them to obtain the Infantry light and heavy armor. These are not custom NPCs.

</details>

Not all NPCs are unfriendly. [The Knight of the Void](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100373) is a fully voiced follower who will assist you. To find her, start by finding the book on Alvor's mantlepiece in the ruins of Riverwood. Be careful though, it's guarded by a rather deadly enemy.

## Getting Started

Now that you have an understanding of the mods used and how the list works mechanically, you can start your playthrough.

When creating your character, race should be taken into consideration due to [Morningstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22298). Feel free to read the mod page and see what bonuses are appealing.

> [!TIP]
> Imperial is the recommended starting race for new players, as you begin with extra perk points to select new aspiration perks, in addition to the usual three.

Once you create your character, please wait for the MCMs to finish loading before doing anything. The second pop-up saying "configuration complete" indicates that you are free to continue. From there, you should select your starting aspiration perks, and then exit the cave.

To your right you will see a chest with some starting items, and to your right is a skill book which you should grab. You should also pick up the note on the table. From there, talk to the NPC to begin the main quest.

Do not go to Falkreath, despite the quest's direction. You will die. Instead, you should head to Oakwood by Lake Ilinalta and get situated. From there, I recommend going down the path to Riverwood (be wary of wraiths, I recommend luring them back to Oakwood to have the guards deal with them). In Riverwood, you can find a book on Alvor's mantle that will lead you to a unique follower. Be careful though, you will encounter a unique boss.

You should focus on gearing up, getting stronger, and exploring. There are six new settlements you can find ([Wynstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50640), [Harold Hold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65552), [Jarnborg](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67992), [Reich Corigate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58214), [Dunpar Wall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60728), and [Oakwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61007)) that have merchants, inns, and general amenities.

From there, you can continue the main quest, or check out the added content listed earlier in this document. There's not a lot of direction, it's very open ended.

Dinoksetiid is meant to be difficult, but fair. If a challenge is too hard, take a break and do something else. Don't rush yourself, games are meant to be fun.
